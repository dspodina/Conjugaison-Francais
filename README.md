## Bonjour and welcome to Pa-ra-pa Parler!

As a junior web developer and French language enthusiast, I created an app for practicing French verb conjugation fun and easy. An
interface is user-friendly and allows you to practice verbs with different tenses and pronouns. I'm constantly updating and improving my project to make language learning more accessible and enjoyable.

- App built using React,
- Styled using Tailwind CSS,
- Configured with Next.js version 13,
- Receiving API responses from RapidAPI,
- Deployed using Netlify.  

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
